# Scalo
This repository provides a simple and well-structured skeleton for an Express application built in TypeScript. The primary objective of this project is to serve as an educational resource for learning about project creation and code simplification. The focus is on setting up the project in a beginner-friendly manner, with the purpose of creating and listing meetings in the user interface. The goal is to facilitate easy learning by demonstrating a clear and organized approach to building an Express application with TypeScript, emphasizing simplicity in code design.

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
When delving into the technology stack employed for crafting the project, a comprehensive set of tools and frameworks were harnessed, including:

**TypeScript:** Renowned for its strong typing and improved developer experience, TypeScript serves as the foundational language, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

**Express:** This minimalist web framework for Node.js forms the backbone of the project, providing the necessary infrastructure for building robust and scalable web applications.

**Vue.js:** Integrated into the project, Vue.js facilitates the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, enriching the overall user experience with its reactive data binding and component-based architecture.

**MongoDB:** As the chosen database, MongoDB contributes to the storage and retrieval of data. Its NoSQL nature allows for flexibility in data modeling, making it a suitable choice for diverse application requirements.

**Mongoose ORM:** Utilized in conjunction with MongoDB, Mongoose ORM simplifies interactions with the database, providing an elegant and schema-based solution for data modeling and validation.

**Webpack:** Serving as the build tool, Webpack optimizes the project's asset management and bundling, ensuring efficient handling of resources and enhancing overall performance.

Together, this comprehensive technology stack synergistically shapes the project's architecture, leveraging the strengths of each component to create a cohesive and feature-rich application.
